        <p>If you are a parent or caregiver of a child who has been sexually abused, it is natural for you to feel shocked and numb about the incident. However, it is important to be calm and remind yourself that your support and
           reassurance can significantly alleviate the impact of the abuse on the child. Child psychiatrist Dr Preeti Jacob of NIMHANS, shares some pointers that can help you effectively offer support to a child who has survived abuse.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://heller.brandeis.edu/">Advocacy and Support Tips for Parents on the Autism Spectrum</a></h4>
        <p>Autistic parents, like other people with disabilities, can take good care of their children. It’s important for parents on the autism spectrum to understand their strengths and weaknesses to help them become the best parents they can be. Getting help with difficult things doesn't’t mean that autistic people are bad parents. Support for parents on the autism spectrum will help them learn the best ways to respond to their children’s needs. 
          They will also feel better about being parents and speaking up for their children when talking to teachers, doctors, and other professionals. Here is a list of ways that parents can learn ways to advocate for themselves and find support.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://heller.brandeis.edu/">Advice and Facts for Mothers and Expecting Mothers with Intellectual Disabilities</a></h4>
        <p>Some mothers have intellectual disabilities. Having an intellectual disability means it is harder to learn and understand things. 
          But everyone can still learn new things. Sometimes it just takes longer. Having an intellectual disability can also mean it is hard to do some things by yourself, so you may need extra help. Mothers with intellectual disabilities can still be good parents and raise their children.</p>

        <p>Once a gentleman came to a doctor complaining that there was something severely wrong with him. He was hurting all over and was very sad but all the tests came out normal. The doctor said, “There is nothing wrong with you. Go to the circus and watch the clown there. He will make you laugh.
          ” The gentleman said, “Doctor, I am that clown.”</p>

        <h4><a href="https://www.littleotterhealth.com/blog">Children’s Mental Health </a></h4>
        <p>Just like adults, children of every age experience feelings of fear, worry, and apprehension from time to time. But if you’re the parent of a child who seems to have a lot of worries, you might find yourself wondering if something more serious is going on.Even though you know your child better than anyone else, when it comes to anxiety, it’s hard to know what falls outside the limits of typical child or adolescent behavior. 
          That’s partly because normal things like avoidance, shyness, and introversion can look a lot like symptoms of an anxiety disorder.

        <h4><a href="https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs">Inspiring My Child’s Mental Health Despite Mental Illness</a></h4>
        <p>Keeping a child mentally healthy can be challenging, especially if your child has a mental illness as mine does. In fact, I think it can 
          be harder than keeping a child physically healthy since keeping the body in shape basically involves a checklist: good diet, check; lots of exercise, check; plenty of water, check; annual checkup, check. A child's mental health, though, can be a bit more complicated.</p>
